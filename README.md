👋 Hi there! I’m a passionate Full Stack .NET developer with a knack for building robust and scalable applications. My journey in software development has led me to work on diverse projects, from enterprise ERPs to cutting-edge communication applications.

🚀 Currently, I’m deeply involved in the development of Engageo, a WhatsApp communication application. Leveraging my skills in .NET, I’m crafting seamless user experiences and ensuring that Engageo stays ahead of the curve.

☁️ When it comes to cloud infrastructure, I’m all about Azure. I’ve harnessed its power to create efficient, reliable, and secure solutions for my clients. Whether it’s deploying microservices or managing data pipelines, Azure is my go-to platform.

🌐 As a full stack developer, I thrive on bridging the gap between front-end magic and back-end logic. From crafting pixel-perfect UIs to optimizing database queries, I love the challenge of creating end-to-end solutions.

📚 When I’m not coding, you’ll find me diving into software architecture, exploring design patterns, and staying up-to-date with industry best practices. I believe that continuous learning is the key to staying relevant in this ever-evolving tech landscape.

🌟 Let’s connect! Feel free to explore my repositories and drop me a message. Whether it’s discussing code, sharing insights, or collaborating on exciting projects, I’m always up for a chat.
